          <h1 class="display-4">Hello World!</h1>

          <p class="lead">I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience in crafting full stack web apps and RESTful APIs using Ruby on Rails(multiple versions of both ruby and rails) framework. I am passionate to develope web apps and web services in Rails and also in teaching programming to the freshers, intermediate developers.</p>

          <p class="lead">I have great experience of working with remote teams accross timezones and always mainitained my availaility whenever required.</p>

          <p class="lead">I have SOILD hands in Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, Sidekiq, RSpec, Heroku, AWS Services like EC2, S3, Integration of variour third party APIs in Rails, GitHub, BitBucket, HTML5, Twitter Bootstrap(v3, v4, v5), JQuery, JavaScript. I also have hands on experience with stimulusjs and React js, but I can deliver higher quality of work in both react and stimulus js.</p>

          <p class="lead fw-bold">Below are my top priorities:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Write clean, effecient, understandable, reusable and easy to maintain code</li>
            <li>Do careful testing of features implemented before releasing the code</li>
            <li>Collaborate whenever required by me or from others</li>
            <li>Never hesitate to share ideas/thoughts about things for improvement</li>
            <li>Always take feedbacks as positive. Because the appreciation motivates me to keep doing better and improving more and complains helps to correct mistakes</li>
            <li>Always accepts the project only if I am confident to meet the expected quality deliverables and timeline.</li>
            <li>Serve one client at a time</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lead">Except the development I also love to teach Ruby on Rails with all other required stack and train the freshers and junior to intermediate developers. I run a youtube channel for teaching and also take offline classes in the morning from 8:00 to 10:00 AM IST.</p>

          <p class="lead">That's in brief about me. We could have a nice discussion when we talk to each other. So let's connect and grow together.</p>
